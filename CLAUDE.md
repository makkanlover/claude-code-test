# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a minimal test repository currently containing only basic project setup files. The project appears to be in its initial stages with no established codebase architecture or development workflow yet.

## Current Structure

- **LICENSE**: MIT License (Copyright 2025 Makkan)
- **README.md**: Contains only the project title "claude-code-test"

## Development Workflow

### Recommended Approach
1. **Explore**: Read relevant files and understand the context
2. **Plan**: Create a detailed implementation plan
3. **Code**: Implement the solution following established patterns
4. **Commit**: Use clear commit messages and create pull requests

### Code Style Guidelines
- Follow consistent coding conventions once established
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests first when implementing new features (TDD approach)
- Ensure all tests pass before committing
- Include both unit and integration tests where appropriate

### Development Notes

This repository currently has no build system, package management, or development tooling configured. When adding code to this project:

1. Establish appropriate tooling based on the chosen technology stack
2. Set up linting and formatting tools
3. Configure testing framework
4. Document build and deployment processes

### Repository Etiquette
- Always create meaningful commit messages
- Use branching strategy for feature development
- Review code changes before merging
- Keep the main branch stable and deployable
